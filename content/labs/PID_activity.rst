.. _PID_activity:

PID Controllers
===============

It can take awhile to gain some intuition about control systems, especially
PID controllers. In this activity you will build a simple PID controller with
your Arduino and adjust the different gain settings to see their effects. This
lab is largely based on a lab written by Bret Comnes and A. La Rosa at Portland
State University. Their original lab activity is available on
`their website <https://www.pdx.edu/nanogroup/sites/www.pdx.edu.nanogroup/files/2013_Arduino%20PID%20Lab_0.pdf>`_
or `GitHub repo <https://github.com/bcomnes/315-lab-microcontroller>`_ .

The control system you will build tries to maintain a constant light level on
a photo resistor. You can think of this like your laptop screen that becomes
brighter or dimmer based on the ambient light levels. This is a closed-loop
system since we have a feedback path. An open-loop equivalent would be a
traditional dimmer switch in a room. If the ambient light (sunlight) level
changes, there is no feedback to change the room lights. You must walk over to
the switch and adjust it manually (feed forward control).

In our system, an LED will shine directly into the photo resistor. The setpoint
of the system is adjustable with a potentiometer on the board. The gains of the
controller can be changed using the serial interface.

Materials
---------
* Arduino UNO
* USB Cable
* LED
* 330 :math:`\Omega` resistor (Orange-Orange-Brown)
* 10k :math:`\Omega` resistor (Brown-Black-Orange)
* Photo resistor
* Breadboard
* M/M Jumper wires
* Computer (Mac, Linux, Windows)

Tasks
-----
1. We could write all of the PID control code ourselves, but there is an
   Arduino library available with a very robust controller. Installing the
   library is easy. Download the library zip file from the GitHub repository
   `here <https://github.com/br3ttb/Arduino-PID-Library/archive/master.zip>`_
   or clone into the `repository <https://github.com/br3ttb/Arduino-PID-Library>`_
   if you are comfortable doing that. Unzip the folder and move it to the
   Arduino library folder. In most installations you will find this in your
   Documents folder: *~/Documents/Arduino/libraries*. If your folder
   has hyphens in the name, change them to underscores. If the Arduino IDE was
   open, restart it. You should find new examples for the PID library in
   *File -> Examples -> PID*. Have a look at the examples to get an idea
   of how the library works.

2. Using the parts in your kit, build the circuit we will use shown below.
   Take a photo of your circuit and attach it to the lab report. (2 pts.)

3. Read the following sketch and upload it to your Arduino.

4. What are the initial values of the :math:`K_p, K_i, K_d` gains? (3 pts.)

5. What happens as you change the set point of the system using the
   potentiometer? (2 pts.)

6. At a fixed set point, change the level of incoming light by shielding the
   setup with your hands and by increasing the light level using a flashlight.
   How fast does the system respond? (2 pts.)

   |

7. Using the serial monitor, change the gain settings by sending three numbers
   separated by commas. For example to set :math:`K_p=2, K_i=10, K_d=0` you
   would send ``2,10,0``. Systematically vary the :math:`K_i` setting with both
   :math:`K_p` and :math:`K_d` set to zero. Describe the effect this has. Why
   is it so? (4 pts.)

   |
   |

8. Set :math:`K_i` to 10 and systematically increase :math:`K_p` with :math:`K_d`
   set to zero. Describe the effect this has. Why is this so? (4 pts.)

   |

9. Set :math:`K_i` to 10 and systematically increase :math:`K_d` with :math:`K_p`
   set to zero. Describe the effect this has. Why is this so? (4 pts.)

10. Does this system have any equivalent mass or inertial effects? (2 pts.)

    you think that is? (2 pts.)
