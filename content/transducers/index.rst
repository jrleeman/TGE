Transducers are how we sense the physical world and turn those measurements into
a quantity we can easily measure and record, such as an electrical voltage.
In this section we will demonstrate a variety of transducers to measure strain,
displacement, force, temperature, and other common physical quantities. We will
also show how calibrations are performed so that the measurements can be
converted to the physical units that we care about. There are many pitfalls
and strengths associated with transducer we will discuss, learning these now
can prevent hours of frustration, wasted funds, and incorrect results.
